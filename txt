The scalability of the arrays and their proccessing time was quite interesting.
 the appending time of the smaller arrays was quite similar, but the insert times
 almost doubled eachother in the beginning, and everything sort of exponentially 
 grew, until you got into the whole seconds for the extraLargeArray, when it came 
 to insertion time. I think the big one was so slow due to the fact that you had to 
 unshift every single number in the array every iteration.
